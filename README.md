## Live Project
You can view the live project [here](https://tyre-web.vercel.app/).

> **Note:** This project uses a free trial database. If the application does not work well, it is likely due to the database being inactive, not issues with the frontend or backend.

## Description

This project began as a simple frontend application for learning Angular unit testing and has evolved into a full-stack application with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It features authentication, authorization, and a database. The UI/UX has been optimized, and the admin management interface supports CRUD operations for products. Future plans include adding user authorization management.

The corresponding backend project, "tyre-api," is available [here](https://github.com/SimonS2019/tyre-api) and is also deployed on Vercel. The database used is MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
